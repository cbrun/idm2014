h1. Introduction

This contains an implementation of the "Exploitation" use case through technologies integrated in the  Gemoc Studio. 

Three DSLs are defined and used in an integrated way to provide tooling and analysis capabilities over an exploitation.

h2. Activities DSL

Its purpose is to capture a static definition of the rules related to some cultures : how they are split in activities
and what might trigger an activity. It also provides a textual syntax (based on Xtext) which makes it 
easier to specific the requirements and to compose expressions.

h2. Exploitation DSL

It is used to capture the structure of a given exploitation. Its break down in fields, the available resources and how
the workgroups are setup in the exploitation.

h2. Simulation DSL

It is used to capture simulation settings and result : a calendar of the activities scheduling.
